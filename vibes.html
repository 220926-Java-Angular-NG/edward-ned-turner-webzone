        Music can be transcendant. 
        That's a goal. If you find a song you really like, you can just, like, listen to it and it alters your relationship with the world around you. 
        That's exciting.

        Music is, of course, a vital component of the human experience.
        It defines, in a lot of ways, what it means to be human:
        our love of numeric patterns,
        the relationship between abstract words and real concepts and how the ambiguity therein allows for so much flexibility,
        our desire to be united together
